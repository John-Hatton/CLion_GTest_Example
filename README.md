CLion Google Test Example
=========================



I've been working lately on improving my C++ coding skills. I felt like it was essential that I got a solid understanding of Unit Testing, and how to prepare a project for unit tests.

Working with the Google Test library can be a bit of a pain. Often you'll find what seems to be promising information, out there on the old interwebs, and it turns out, that that solution only applied to version x. We're on version x+10 now and everything is different.

CLion
-----

For this project I'm using JetBrains CLion. It's a fantastic program, giving you much of the tools you're familiar with with IntelliJ or Android Studio, but with C and C++ code! 

I wanted to get good at this, and you have to start somewhere.

Running the Tests:
------------------

To run the tests, navigate (in CLion of course) to the tests folder, and open GTest_Example.cpp. There should be a run icon next to the two test cases. 


Alternatively, you can click on the configurations menu, and select google_tests, to run all the Google Tests in the tests folder.
